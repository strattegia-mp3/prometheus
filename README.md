## Env Variables

For the project to work perfectly, a file `.env.local` must be created at the root of the project following the variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHCMS_ENDPOINT='yourMasterEnvironmentGraphQL'
GRAPHCMS_TOKEN='yourPermanentTokenGraphQL'
```

**P.S.**: Don't forget the `npm install` command to install all dependencies that are required.
